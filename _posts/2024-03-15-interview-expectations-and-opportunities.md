After I completed my first round of graduate school applications and interviews, I realized I was doing a lot of housekeeping and organizing for files that others might find useful. There are hundreds of "Questions to ask at the academic interview" and "What to expect at the academic interview" pages on the internet, but this one is the one I created.

A bit about my values and my personality, which are contextually helpful for understanding the questions I ask:

* The labs I've enjoyed working at most are the ones where I had the freedom to develop my own line of research
* After years of working in industry, I've learned that maintaining a work-life balance allows me to be more productive in the long-run.

What are interviews and why do them?
------
Some graduate programs require or allow interviews with faculty members or admissions officers before admission. 
An interview is your chance to show the committee who you are and that you have done your research! Be yourself, and focus on why you’re 
interested in this institution and professor. They also want to see indications that you understand the reality of the program and grad school in general.

An interview is also your chance to learn about the school, program, and professors you'll be working with. 
If you are admitted without an interview, I highly recommend reaching out
to the professor(s) you are interested in working with and setting up a meeting. You will be working with this professor
for several years, and they will form a strong, meaningful basis of your academic career, so you want to ensure that you 
can work together! Unfortunately, professors tend to be overbooked, so expect that you'll likely only have 30 minutes to talk.

While you are in town, take a campus tour, explore the area, and meet students, especially students who are advisees of your potential advisor(s). 
A campus visit offers you the opportunity to demonstrate strong interpersonal skills (if you're being considered for admission)
and gain a better sense of the school’s environment.

Things to keep in mind during the process
-----------
* How does the campus feel?
  * Are there spots you can work?
* Do current students seem happy + feel supported?
* Does the PI maintain a work/life balance? When do they answer emails?
* Is the advisor-student relationship formal or casual?
* Is the advisor involved in professional development outside research?
* What are the lab demographics?

Questions for you
-----------
* **Why** do you want a **graduate degree**? / Why do you want to do research?
* What **other schools** did you apply to?
* Why do you think this program is a good fit for you? **Why this program?**

Questions to Ask Potential professors’ students
